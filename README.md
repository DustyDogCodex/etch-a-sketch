# etch-a-sketch
Creating an Etch-A-Sketch website for the Odin Project!

This project will be a website where you can use your mouse to interact with an Etch-a-sketch interface. An etch-a-sketch is a game where you can create an image using a stylus (in our project, by using a mouse) and then erase it when done. In this project, I will be creating a webiste that does the same thing. The website will have a grid that an user can draw on. The user can hover the mouse over the grid on the website and use it to draw an image on the screen. Once the user is done with their image, they can clear the screen to make another image. Additionally, the user will be able to change the size of the grid to make smaller or larger images on the screen.

Through this project I learned:
